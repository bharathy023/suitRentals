Multi Period Planning

Wearhouse Rentals rents suits for wedding and other special occasions. 
The Chicago branch is planning to meet demand for next month. 
The number dij of suits required on the jth day for suit i is known in 
advance based on the reservations made. To satisfy this requirement, Wearhouse Rentals 
can either have the suits laundered or borrow from a different branch. 
The laundry provides both fast and slow cleaning services. 
In fast service, suits are returned 1 day later for a cost of $12 per suit, 
and in slow service, suits are returned 3 day later at a cost of $9 per suit. 
The cost to get a suit shipped from nearby branches is $15 per suit. 
The borrowed suit can be used till the end of the month. 
Assume the rented suits are returned the next day.
